# Mask_Detection
This project helps in detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not using Python.
Libraries used are:
-YOLO3 for human detection
-VIOLA JONES for face detection.

A Pre-trained model - MobileNetV2 - is used for better outcome in the algorithm.

To run this model one only has to run detect_mask_video.py
